# Functional Programming Journey

## Objective

Functional Programming is important in numerous fields, including data engineering.
For me, the reason to learn functional programming was to increase reusability of code and allow development in a more test friendly codebase.

Also, for dealing with concurrency, functional programming proves it's value as well since it can separate different timelines based on it's structure.
Working with data pipelines, it seems important to keep the data validity. And a well designed functional programming structure helps to keep a strong pipeline.

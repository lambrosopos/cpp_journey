# Functional Programming Journey

## Objective

Functional Programming is important in numerous fields, including data engineering.
For me, the reason to learn functional programming was to increase reusability of code and allow development in a more test friendly codebase.

Also, for dealing with concurrency, functional programming proves it's value as well since it can separate different timelines based on it's structure.
Working with data pipelines, it seems important to keep the data validity. And a well designed functional programming structure helps to keep a strong pipeline.

## Usage

FP journey will be used to create future data pipelines and CLI programs etc. Specifically, data pipelines that involve concurrency and reusability.

CLI programs will also be designed with FP method so that in the future modularity can be considered.

## Programming Language

There are programming languages that are designed for FP. But any language can use concepts from FP.

For this journey, I will be using Scala

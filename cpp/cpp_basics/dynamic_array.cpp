/* dynamic array - vector
 * in the std namespace there is vector
 * which is essentially a dynamic array
 *
 * vector is basically a set that allows duplicate elements
 * which is basically an array.
 *
 * however unlike an array, a vector can resize.
 *
 * Thus you don't need to give it a specific size.
 *
 * You just create a vector and add elements to it.
 *
 * When a vector is initiated, it creates space for certain amount of elements
 * and whenever more space is needed, it creates a new space and transfers the elements.
